To use the script, simply open your console/terminal then type your python path (PATH or wherever you installed your python) followed by the script path. If you have an IDE, you can run it through that as well (e.g. PyCharm, Wing IDE, Visual Studio, etc.).

This script works for any valid number of seats, number of people who sit correctly before rotating the table, and any amount of matches. It will print the lists that, no matter how much you rotate the table, will never have more than a given number of matches.
